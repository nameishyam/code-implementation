## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/code-implementation.git
   cd code-implementation
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** and activate it:

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Improving documentation (README, architecture diagrams, etc.)
- Enhancing the DRNet architecture
- Improving SRGAN-proposed generator or discriminator modules
- Adding new evaluation metrics or visualization tools
- Optimizing classification models
- Improving test coverage
- Bug fixes and performance enhancements

---

## Code Standards

- Follow **PEP8** for Python coding conventions.
- Modularize components (e.g., DRNet, SRGAN, Classification) into distinct packages where possible.
- Write **docstrings** for every function/class.
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.11+.
- Use **type hints** and **logging** where applicable.

---

## Commit Guidelines

- Use meaningful commit messages that explain _why_ the change was made.
- Reference relevant issues (e.g., `Fixes #42` or `Closes #7`).
- Example format:
  ```
  feat(srgan): added attention mechanism in generator
  fix(classifier): resolve image size mismatch error
  docs: updated README with architecture flowchart
  ```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them.
3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
   ```
4. Open a **Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
