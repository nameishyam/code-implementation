## Overview

The Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Project is designed to empower healthcare professionals by automating the screening and grading processes of diabetic retinopathy. The core of our system is the custom-built **DRNet** class, a tailored deep learning model that integrates the SRGAN framework for super-resolution enhancement, ensuring that even low-quality retinal images are optimized for accurate classification.

By fusing image super-resolution with state-of-the-art classification techniques, this project aims to streamline the diagnostic process, reduce manual intervention, and provide a scalable solution for large-scale screening initiatives.

## Features

- **Custom DRNet Architecture:** A bespoke deep learning model tailored to the specific challenges of retinal image analysis.
- **SRGAN Integration:** Utilizes Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) to enhance image quality, yielding improved feature extraction and diagnostic accuracy.
- **Advanced Classification Module:** Implements a sophisticated classification pipeline for detecting and grading the severity of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Automated Preprocessing:** Includes data normalization, augmentation, and noise reduction to standardize and optimize incoming images.
- **Scalable and Modular Design:** Engineered for seamless integration into clinical workflows and adaptable for future enhancements.
- **Real-Time Analytics and Reporting:** Provides dynamic dashboards for monitoring screening progress and evaluating model performance.
- **Robust Security Measures:** Ensures that patient data is handled in strict accordance with HIPAA and other regulatory standards.

## Architecture

### DRNet Overview

- **Custom DRNet Class:** The backbone of our model, DRNet is engineered to balance depth and computational efficiency. It is designed specifically for medical imaging challenges, providing high accuracy in identifying subtle pathological features.
- **SRGAN Integration:** Preprocessing leverages SRGAN to significantly enhance the resolution of retinal images before they are processed by DRNet, enabling the model to capture finer details.
- **Classification Pipeline:** After super-resolution and feature extraction, the classification module categorizes images based on severity levels. The pipeline is modular, allowing for independent updates to individual components without disrupting the overall system.
